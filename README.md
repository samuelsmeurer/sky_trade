Here you will find the software and tests related to the drone radar using the ESP32 microcontroller. It includes detailed instructions on how to compile and upload the code to the ESP32 board, along with information about ongoing tests.

### [`others`](https://github.com/samuelsmeurer/sky_trade/tree/main/others) Folder
This folder stores secondary files, such as images used in this repository and additional test codes. An internal document summarizes all relevant additional information.
