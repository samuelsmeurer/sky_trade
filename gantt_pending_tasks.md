# Next Steps

## 1. Physical Drone Tests
   - **Objective:** Conduct practical tests with physical drones to identify potential problems and challenges in operation and data transmission.
   - **Actions:**
     - Execute a series of test flights with different drone models to assess stability, transmission range, and accuracy of remote ID data.
     - Document all issues encountered during the tests, including interference, range limitations, and compatibility issues.

## 2. Study of Drone Information Transmission via BLE and Code Adaptation
   - **Objective:** Study the feasibility and implement the transmission of remote ID data via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).
   - **Actions:**
     - Analyze technical documentation to understand the specifications and capabilities of BLE in drones.
     - Adapt and optimize existing code to capture and decode remote ID packets sent via BLE.
     - Test the transmission and reception of data via BLE under various conditions to ensure effectiveness and reliability.

## 3. Performance Evaluation of the System in Real Conditions
   - **Objective:** Evaluate how the remote ID reception system performs in real environments and with prolonged use.
   - **Actions:**
     - Implement field tests to monitor the performance of the system under different weather conditions and interference.
     - Analyze energy consumption and processing efficiency to ensure the system is viable for use in mobile or autonomous devices.
